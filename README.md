# Historical Context
The cipher is believed to be an ancient cipher and is said to have originated with the Hebrew religios leader. There is evidence that suggests that the Knights Templar utilized a pig-pen cipher during the Christian Crusades. It was also used by someone in the 16th century with the goal to "save his personal notes." Sometimes, you can still see it today on gravestones. Basically, the cypher goes a long way back in time, and is clearly a big part of history.
