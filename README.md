# Historical Context
The cipher is believed to be an ancient cipher and is said to have originated with the Hebrew religios leader. There is evidence that suggests that the Knights Templar utilized a pig-pen cipher during the Christian Crusades. It was also used by someone in the 16th century with the goal to "save his personal notes." Sometimes, you can still see it today on gravestones. Basically, the cypher goes a long way back in time, and is clearly a big part of history.

*How complex is it?*

(How pigpen is writen)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XRTcLYy40]

with the source of this lovely video... i learned how to write in pigpen in just two minutes!  The compexility wasnt hard to understand at all.  Once you got the hang of it, it seemed so easy.  But for anyone else who wouldnt know this, i could imagine how hard it would be for them.  From the looks of it, it just looks like a 5 year old tried making a new language.
