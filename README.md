# Final Analysis
The pigpen code was most comonly used in the 18th century during the American Civil War. It is a huge part of the Freemasons' history and is still seen on some gravestones to this day. I think it stopped being used because it eventually became more popular and so hiding secret messages was harder and harder so people moved on to another code.
